# Blitz-X
ICT2202 Digital Forensics Team Project Assignment 1 - Team Panzerwerfer

## Objectives
Blitz-X (Blitz-eXtractor) is a modular forensic triage tool written in Python designed to access various forensic artifacts on Windows relating to user data exfiltration. The tool will parse the artifacts, and present them in a format viable for analysis. The output may provide valuable insights during an incident response in a Windows environment while waiting for a full disk image to be acquired. The tool is meant to run on live systems on the offending User Account with administrative rights.
